                    Your privacy is critically important to us. At Automattic, we have a few fundamental principles:
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.</li>

                        <li>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.</li>

                        <li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.</li>

                        <li>We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.</li>

                        <li>We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.</li>

                    </ol>

                    <article><abbr title="How do you do ">Howdy!</abbr> We are the folks behind a variety of products and services designed to allow anyone — from bloggers, to photographers, small business owners, and enterprises — to take full advantage of the power and promise of the open web. Our mission is to democratize publishing and commerce so that anyone with a story can tell it, and anyone can turn their great idea into a livelihood. We believe in powering the open internet with code that is open source and are proud to say that the vast majority of our work is available under the General Public License (“GPL”). Unlike most other services, because our GPL code is public, you can actually download and <a href="https://automattic.com/privacy/?utm_medium=automattic_referred&utm_source=jpcom_footer">take a look at</a>  that code to see how it works.</article>

                <p>
                    One of the most important contents to include in your help center is frequently asked questions (FAQs). It allows customers to quickly find answers to common questions without submitting a support ticket. Keep your FAQs up-to-date to ensure they remain helpful.

                    Another important type of content to include is product documentation. This can include user manuals, guides, and tutorials that provide step-by-step instructions for using your product.
